    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>I am a recent graduate of UNC Charlotte with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Spanish. I would say that I enjoy problem solving although
        that's obviously a cliche. I like to find ways of doing things that are different from or especially more direct than the normal or intended solutions.
        I believe in really committing to work and looking for the best method rather than sacrifing true drive in order to check boxes for something that looks like a good job.
        I enjoy learning, I have strong mental and physical energy, and I try to be enthusiastic about everything. My preferred career
        is to work with software or something in information technology. However, 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">the availability in this field is decreasing</a> and 
        I am becoming more open to an educational job. I am located currently in Charlotte.
